  ## The Dataset:
  The data was taken from Kaggle site :  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud .

  The Columns do not have physical significance directly visible since as per the source (Kaggle) , the data was compressed using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in order to protect the privacy of the individuals while making a realistic secnario dataset availaible to public .
